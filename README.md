# web-scraping-challenge

### part_1_mars_news.ipynb
This jupyter notebook scrapes the website: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html for the titles and previews of each of the articles on the page and adds them all to a list

### part_2_mars_weather.ipynb
This jupyter notebook file scrapes the website: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html, for Martian weather data. It then analyzes the average temperature and pressure for each Martian month. It then visualizes the average temperatures over the year and uses this information to deduce how many days are in a Martian year. The data is exported to mars_data.csv.

All code is my original work.
